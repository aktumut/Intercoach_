Some people talk too fast, or think too long, or give too many details. 

They can look unconfident with their skills, and give the wrong impression to the recruiter.
Most importantly this situation can outshine your technical know-how.

All of these small things are quite important behaviors for getting the job.

* Optimizing your time of the speech and speed,
